Full-CI programming
=====================

1. Using the N-resolution method will obtain the result with great error. For example, the result of H2 1.1 ccpvdz:

        H2 ccpvdz
        E(FCI) = -3.191343197476
        Benchmark
        E(FCI) = -1.123735236610
    miserably.

2. The algorithm of N-resolution itself is rather low.

3. Try to use the Minimal Operation-Count Method to rewrite.
